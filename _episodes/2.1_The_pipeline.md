The basic steps in a differential expression (DE) pipeline include:
- __Raw data and quality checking__
  - Obtain sequencing data in [Fastq](https://sapac.support.illumina.com/bulletins/2016/04/fastq-files-explained.html) format 
  - Quality checking with [fastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and [multiQC](https://multiqc.info/examples/wgs/multiqc_report.html)
  - Quality trimming with [Trim galore](bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)
- __Alignment and Visualisation__
  - Alignment with STAR aligner
  - Visualisation using ...
- __Differential Expression Analysis__
  - Generating the Gene-count matrix. 
  - Identifying statistically significant DE genes using [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)
  - Functional enrichment analysis using [clusterProfiler](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html)

We will discuss each of the steps in detail.
