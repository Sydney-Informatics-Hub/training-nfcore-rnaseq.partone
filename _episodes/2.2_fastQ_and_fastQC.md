__Challenge__
- Identify
  - How many sequences were in SRR3473989_selected.fastq?
  - What are the lengths of the reads in SRR3473989.fastq?
  - Which part of the reads tend to have worse per base sequence quality? `Hint`- Use the tool for visualisation of read quality 

- When inspecting FastQC reports for RNA seq data, you may notice the categories “Per base sequence content” and “Sequence Duplication Levels” marked as failing QC. 
  - Why do you think this is?
  - Is it still ok to use these samples?
