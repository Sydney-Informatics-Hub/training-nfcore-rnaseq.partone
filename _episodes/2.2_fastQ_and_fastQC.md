__Challenge__
- __Identify__
  - How many sequences were in SRR3473989_selected.fastq?
  - What are the lengths of the reads in SRR3473989.fastq?
  - Which part of the reads tend to have worse per base sequence quality? `Hint`- Use the tool for visualisation of read quality 

- __From Fastqc reports__
  - What do you think each of the components means? Refer to the documentation if needed.
  - Do you think this dataset is of “good” quality?
