questions:
- "How do I setup my base directory?"
- "How do I download the required input files on the Nimbus VM instance?"
objectives:

keypoints:
- All the required files for this workshop are downloaded in a single compressed file.
---

#### Make a directory called 'base_directory'.
```
mkdir base_directory
```

#### Download the compressed file (.tar.gz) and set up the working directory

In your terminal, type the following to move into to the __base_directory__:
```
cd base_directory
```
Then type the following to download the input files:
```
git clone https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/RNASeq_materials.git
```

The file is packaged up to save space. Move the file to the current directory and Unpack it:
```
mv RNASeq_materials/working_directory.tar.gz ./
tar -zxvf working_directory.tar.gz
```

This creates a directory 'working_directory'. Move into this directory using the command
```
cd working_directory
```

The `working_directory` folder contains the following files
* 6 files : SRR*_selected.fastq.gz
* A samplesheet.csv and 
* A nextflow.config file. 
* FULL_count_matrix.txt
* rnaseq_DE_Full_matrix_DryRun.Rmd (Day 2)
* rnaseq_DE_Full_matrix_DryRun.html (Day 2)

You can list all the files in your current directory by typing `ls -lh`.

Check your path by typing:
```
pwd
```
- You should be in the path: ```/home/training/base_directory/working_directory``` 
- If you are not, move into the above path by typing:
```
cd /home/training/base_directory/working_directory
```
