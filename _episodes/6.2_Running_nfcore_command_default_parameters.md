title: "Deploy the RNA-seq workflow nfcore-rnaseq on Pawsey’s Nimbus Cloud"
teaching: 10
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What does the actual nfcore-rnaseq command look like?"
- "What are the main input parameters?"
- "What are the outputs?"
- "What are the output log files?"

objectives:
- "Understanding and excecuting the nfcore-rnaseq command, it's inputs and outputs"

keypoints:
- Pawsey Nimbus VM is a good resource to run nfcore piplelines
- System resouces such as cpus and memory can be customised per step using config files.
- Excecution and timeline logs files provide a detailed summary of the run.

### Running the pipeline on Pawsey-Nimbus VM

- Please go back to the command-line(Terminal) window on which you have logged on to the Nimbus training instance.
Check your path by typing:
```
pwd
```
- You should be in the path: `/home/training/base_directory/working_directory` 
- If you are not, move into the above path by typing:
```
cd /home/training/base_directory/working_directory
```

#### Excecuting the Nextflow nfcore-rnaseq pipeline
We will run the single nfcore-rnaseq command using a utility called __screen__ in unix.

What is the `screen` command?
- __The screen command__ in Linux provides the ability to launch and use multiple shell sessions from a single ssh session. 
- When a process is started with ‘screen’, the process can be detached from session & then can reattach the session at a later time. 
- When the session is detached, the process that was originally started from the screen is still running and managed by the screen itself. 
- The process can then re-attach the session at a later time, and the terminals are still there, the way it was left.


#### (1) Start a new screen window 
-S: It will start a new window within the screen and also gives a name to the window. 
It creates a session which is identified by that name. The name can be used to reattach screen at a later stage.

```
screen -S run_nextflow_in_screen
```

#### (2) Run the nfcore-rnaseq command 
```
cvmfs_path=/cvmfs/data.biocommons.aarnet.edu.au/Final_resources_250722
  
nextflow run $cvmfs_path/nfcore_pipeline/rnaseq/ \                                                # The nfcore-rnaseq excecutable file
                --input samplesheet.csv \                                                         # samplesheet file-name
                -profile singularity \                                                            # profile e.g. singularity
                --fasta $cvmfs_path/Mouse_chr18_reference/chr18.fa \                              # Path: Genome fasta file
                --gtf $cvmfs_path/Mouse_chr18_reference/chr_18_startOfLine.gtf \                  # Path: annotation (gtf) file
                --star_index $cvmfs_path/Mouse_chr18_reference/chr18_STAR_singularity_index/ \    # Path: Genome 'STAR' index file
                --max_memory '6 GB' --max_cpus 2 \                                                # memory and cpu resources 
                --outdir results \
                -with-report excecution_report.html \                                             # Excecution log file-name 
                -with-timeline timeline_report.html                                               # Timeline log file-name
```
- The [CernVM File System](https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/) i.e. `cvmfs` provides a scalable, reliable and low-maintenance software distribution service.
- The names of cvmfs folders (e.g. __Final_resources_250722__) and files need to be standardised (make these more user-friendly). This is __work in progress__.


#### (3) Detach from the above screen session
-d: It is used to detach a screen session so that it can be reattached in future. 
It can also be done with the help of shortcut key ```Ctrl-a + d```

#### (4) Reattach the screen-session to check the progress
-r: It is used to reattach a screen session which was detached in past.
```
screen -r run_nextflow_in_screen
```
Repeat Steps (3) and (4) to check the the excecution status of the command.

- The nfcore-rnaseq command will take about 18-22 minutes to run to completion.
- In the mean time we will proceed to discuss some of the important log files. 
- We plan to make a `pre-processed results folder` available for download. If one of more trainees have a runtime problem, they will be able view these pre-computed results.   
- An `scp command` to transfer required files from the results folder on the VM instance to your local machine will also be made available.
