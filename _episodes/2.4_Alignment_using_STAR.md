- After trimming, the next step of processing RNA-seq data is to map the reads to a reference genome. 
- RNA-seq specific aligner needs to be used to accomodate splicing.
- The most commonly used aligners for short-read sequencing are STAR, HISAT2 etc.
- The output of the alignment step is a [bam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format)) file, which is a compressed ("B"inary) form of a [sam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format)) file.
