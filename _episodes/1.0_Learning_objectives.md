#### How to refresh your unix shell (bash) skills?
```
- Opening a terminal window.
- Handling directories and files.
- Visualising contents of text files.
```

#### Step I :  Why use nfcore-rnaseq?
```
- A typical bioinformatics workflow - too complicated?
- Nextflow as a workflow management systems, how does it help?
- Use nfcore’s rnaseq pipeline to transform raw sequencing data into analysis ready count data.
```

#### A platform to run nfcore-rnaseq pipeline 
```
- The Pawsey/Nimbus virtual machine (VM)
- Introduction to trainee VMs from Pawsey
- How to log on to a trainee VM?
```

#### Run nfcore-rnaseq
```
. What are basic steps involved?
. What are the main inputs?
. What are the main outputs? 
. Count matrix for Step II: Downstream analysis
```

#### A specifc case study using RNA-Seq
```
. Knockout mouse model to study Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS)
. Experimental design
. Experimental question
