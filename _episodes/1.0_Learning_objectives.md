#### RNA-Seq
```
- What is RNA-Seq?
- What are the main applications of RNA-Seq
- How does a basic RNA-seq workflow look like?
- What is the experimental case-study for this workshop?
```

#### A specific case-study using RNA-Seq
```
. Knockout mouse model to study Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS)
. Experimental design
. Experimental question
```

#### Refresh your unix shell (bash) skills
```
- Opening a terminal window.
- Handling directories and files.
- Visualising contents of text files.
```


#### Basic steps in the differential expression pipeline

- Alignment against reference and visualisation
- Differential Expression Analysis
```

#### Step I :  Why use nfcore-rnaseq?
```
- A typical bioinformatics workflow - too complicated?
- Nextflow as a workflow management systems, how does it help?
- Use nfcore’s rnaseq pipeline to transform raw sequencing data into analysis ready count data.
```

#### Pawsey/Nimbus VM: A platform to run nfcore-rnaseq pipeline
