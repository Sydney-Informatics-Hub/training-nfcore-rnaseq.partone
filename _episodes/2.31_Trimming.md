- Trimming is sometimes performed to improve the quality of the raw data and potentially improve its mappability. 
- There are several ways to perform trimming:
  - Removal of poor quality reads or bases (e.g. ends of reads)
  - Removal of adapter sequences
  - Removal of polyA tails


## Note for the curious
 
Be very wary about trimming RNA sequencing data
Trimming of poor quality reads can affect gene expression estimates (Williams at el., 2016)

Trimming of high quality adapter sequences was shown to increase quality and reliability of biological signals in RNA-seq data (Dozmorov et al., 2015)
